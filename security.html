					In the 21<sup>st</sup> century it is imperative that any business engaged in sales do so over the Internet. In the 1970's Microsoft launched its <i>"A Computer In Every Home"</i> marketing campaign. It was nonetheless successful in the western world. Today Android and Apple are putting smart-phones and tablets in the hands of every consumer; while Verizon and its competitors see to their global connectivity. The fact is a Brick and Mortar store can only see so much foot traffic in a day. But an online store can handle near infinite visitors.

						If your business houses information on its guests it has an automatic obligation to insure the security of its systems. This means following legal and industry standards for encryption, hashing, and in the inevitable event of an attack minimizing leaks.

					<h3 class="text-center">For Your Business</h3>
					<p>
						The greatest dangers to a business' security is typically in-house. For retailers, it's employees shop-lifting. For online businesses it's acquiring more data than needed to perform their job or taking this data to market. From an engineering perspective it is sub-par development of front facing systems granting escalated access to attackers. Any cyber attack can cost a business millions up to and including a forced closing at court. This service is geared to mitigate or eliminate as many vectors as possible.
